(In my experience the trouble when choosing a griding api like jqgrid or yui datatable, as they came along with a huge css file.. I am a novice at understanding css.. hence had much trouble when trying to match grid css with project base css). respo.grid has a smaller css file, but is currently tightly couple to bootstrap.css ..\r\n*  **A grid api that is responsive**. Before writing respo.grid , I was on a look out for resposive grids and came across Footable, which is an amazing api for responsive tables. In fact, my first approach was to customize it and add api's to it, but latter I ended up writing respo.grid from scratch as i needed the grid to be modular and not a jquery extension. And also need many customizations  like scroll bar with fixed header, ajax json loads.., search div builder from grid columns.  Nevertheless the basic responsiveness design of the respo.grid is shamelessly copied from Footable,even if the code generating is different.  \r\n\r\nTo get started:\r\n```\r\n$ git pull https://github.com/gokulvanan/respo.grid.git\r\n$ cd respo.grid\r\n$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer // this will run the project files on localhost:8000  \r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck out the examples localData.html, ajaxData.html.\r\n\r\n### Grid Options\r\nLazy to write this now..
